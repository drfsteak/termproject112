# Pac-Man Extended

## Description

Pac-Man Extended includes all the features of the original Pac-Man game, and includes a sandbox mode where the user can create their own mazes. In both gamemodes, users play as Pac-Man, avoiding the classic ghosts Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde, which each have their own movement patterns. Players can collect pellets to gain points, and each special power pellets to gain temporary invincibility, allowing them to eat the ghosts in this duration.

In the sandbox mode, users can create their own mazes by clicking the mouse to draw the walls, pellets, and power pellets. Sandbox mode has the same rules as the original Pac-Man game.
